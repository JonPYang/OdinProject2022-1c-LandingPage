# OdinProject2022-1c-LandingPage
Recreate pages as shown by https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

Initially misunderstood the project and set up index.html to redirect to frontpage.html and fonts.html. Did entire work in frontpage.html and /styles/frontpage.css. Copied each corresponding page into index.html and styles.css at very end in order to upload assignment for convenient access. Leaving frontpage.html and /styles/frontpage.css undisturbed so history can be conveniently viewed.
